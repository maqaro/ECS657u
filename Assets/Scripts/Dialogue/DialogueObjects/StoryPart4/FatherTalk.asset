  dialogue:
  - Yes, your father. He who's sword was known as the white flash. Your father stayed
    true to his creed as a samura and waited atop the valley of death for Lord Asano.
  - Your father was a force to be reckoned with. Even Lord Asano had to be weary...
  - Corpse after corpse, left in his wake. As he awaited... Lord Asano's arrival.
    Heed my words Haruhiko. He was Nozarashi. Blade of the Shogunate. And till he
    faced Lord Asano he had never known defeat.
